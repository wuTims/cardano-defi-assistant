### Migration Timeline ###

  Week 1: Vercel Testing

  Day 1-2: Migrate to Prisma
  - Replace RPC functions
  - Test bulk insert fix
  - Verify balance calculations

  Day 3-4: Add Upstash Redis
  - Implement caching
  - Test simple queue operations

  Day 5: Validate everything works
  - Run test syncs (within timeout)
  - Verify data integrity

  Week 2: Railway Migration

  Day 1: Set up Railway project
  - Deploy Next.js app
  - Configure services

  Day 2: Add BullMQ
  - Real queue implementation
  - Deploy workers

  Day 3: Test full sync
  - Run long-running syncs
  - Monitor worker performance

  Day 4-5: Cutover
  - Update DNS
  - Monitor production

  ðŸ”„ The Beauty of This Approach

  Your Code Evolution:

  Stage 1 (Vercel Testing):
  // Simplified queue for testing
  if (process.env.USE_BULLMQ === 'false') {
    return new SimpleQueue() // HTTP-based
  }

  Stage 2 (Railway Production):
  // Real BullMQ with same interface
  if (process.env.USE_BULLMQ === 'true') {
    return new BullMQQueue() // Persistent Redis
  }

  What Stays The Same:

  - âœ… All your Prisma queries
  - âœ… All your business logic
  - âœ… All your API routes
  - âœ… Your Next.js frontend

  What Changes:

  - âœ… SimpleQueue â†’ BullMQ (same interface!)
  - âœ… Upstash Redis (HTTP) â†’ Redis (persistent)
  - âœ… Vercel â†’ Railway hosting

  ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

  1. Prisma works everywhere - Test on Vercel, deploy on Railway
  2. Redis has two modes - HTTP (Upstash) for Vercel, persistent for Railway
  3. Queue abstraction - Same interface, different implementations
  4. Zero code rewrite - Just environment-based service selection

  Final Architecture on Railway:

  Railway Services:
  â”œâ”€â”€ Next.js App (no changes!)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend pages
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ API routes
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WebSocket support
  â”œâ”€â”€ BullMQ Worker
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Wallet sync
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Price tracking
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Background jobs
  â”œâ”€â”€ PostgreSQL (included)
  â””â”€â”€ Redis (included)

  ### Conversation ###

  Read docs/migrations/prisma-bullmq-migration-plan and update that document with what you know now. You need to know exactly what needs to 
  be setup when for us to test. I don't want to get stuck in a debug loop of broken migration pieces. Ensure you're fully aware of how all of
   our current components interact with each other and how our multi-phase migration plan will work with Vercel + Redis, and then Vercel + 
  Railway + Redis + BullMQ. Because we already have a simple queue + worker + cache implented. We need to understand how to properly adapt 
  the new stack of technology in a methodical/systematic way to ensure we dont run into any issues and dont miss any gaps. Ultrathink.

  The user wants me to update the migration plan document with the new insights about the two-phase approach:
  1. Phase 1: Test on Vercel with Prisma + Upstash Redis (no BullMQ due to persistent connection requirements)
  2. Phase 2: Move to Railway with full BullMQ support

  They already have:
  - A simple queue implementation (using Supabase sync_jobs table)
  - A worker (SyncWorker)
  - A cache implementation (in-memory-cache.ts and token-cache.ts)

  I need to:
  1. Read the current migration plan
  2. Update it with the clearer two-phase approach
  3. Be very specific about what can and can't work in each phase
  4. Address the existing components and how they'll be migrated
  5. Ensure no gaps in the migration process

  Let me first read the current plan to understand what needs updating.

  The user is asking me to update the migration plan document with what I know now about the two-phase approach. They want to ensure we don't
   get stuck in a debug loop and that we understand exactly how to migrate from their current setup to the new stack.

  Let me continue thinking through this systematically.

  I'm systematically thinking through the migration plan. Let me continue with the specific implementation details.

  Good, I'm thinking through the service factory pattern which is crucial for a smooth migration. Let me continue with the specific testing 
  strategy.

  I'm being thorough about what can and can't be tested in each phase. This is crucial to avoid surprises. Let me finish with the migration 
  rollback strategy.

  The user wants me to read the existing migration plan document and update it with the new understanding about the two-phase approach 
  (Vercel + Upstash first, then Railway + BullMQ). I should create a new todo list to track this documentation update task.
