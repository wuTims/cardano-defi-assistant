# Root Cause Fixes - August 12, 2025

## Summary
Replaced band-aid fixes with proper solutions addressing root causes of three major issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Full Sync on Every Page Load
**Root Cause**: Data model mismatch - sync metadata split incorrectly across tables
- `wallet_sync_status` table had `last_synced_at`
- `wallets` table didn't have sync metadata
- `/api/wallet` was querying wrong table

**Fix**: 
- Modified `/api/wallet` to join `wallet_sync_status` table
- Properly extracts sync metadata from joined query
- Now correctly detects if wallet has been synced before

### 2. ✅ BigInt Type Mismatch Error
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent type handling between backend and frontend
- API was converting BigInt to strings
- Frontend components expected BigInt values

**Fix**:
- Keep BigInt types in backend consistently
- Use JSON replacer function for proper serialization
- Deserialize strings back to BigInt in frontend service layer
- Maintains type consistency throughout the stack

### 3. ✅ Multiple Sync Logs (3 attempts)
**Root Cause**: Overlapping retry configurations
- Global mutation retry: 1
- Sync mutation retry: 1
- Total possible attempts: 3

**Fix**:
- Set global mutation retry to 0
- Let individual mutations control their retry logic
- Single source of truth for retries

### 4. ✅ Simplified Abort Controller
**Previous Complex Logic**:
- Checking if already aborted
- Conditional abort with reason
- Duplicate state management

**Fixed Simple Logic**:
- Leverage `cancelRequest()` method
- AbortController.abort() is idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
- Clear, single-purpose code

### 5. ✅ Cleaned Up Error Handling
**Removed**:
- Unnecessary try-catch blocks in `syncWallet`
- Redundant abort error checks
- Complex conditional error logging

**Result**:
- Cleaner, more readable code
- Errors bubble up naturally
- Single error handling at appropriate level

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before
- 175 lines of band-aid fixes
- Complex nested conditionals
- Duplicate error handling
- Type mismatches

### After
- Clean, simple implementations
- Single responsibility functions
- Consistent type handling
- Proper separation of concerns

## Lessons Learned

1. **Fix root causes, not symptoms** - The sync issue was a data model problem, not a caching issue
2. **Trust built-in APIs** - AbortController already handles edge cases
3. **Keep types consistent** - Handle serialization at the edge, not throughout the codebase
4. **Single source of truth** - One place for retry logic, not multiple overlapping configs
5. **Simple is robust** - Less code means fewer bugs

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] BigInt values serialize/deserialize correctly
- [x] Sync only happens for new wallets
- [x] Existing wallet data loads from database
- [x] Single sync attempt (no duplicate logs)
